# @~/release-it-changeset-plugin

A simple release-it plugin that adds a "Changements" section to the changelog from markdown files in `.release-it-changeset/`.

## How it works

This plugin reads `.md` files from `.release-it-changeset/` and inserts them as a "Changements" section in the changelog, right after the version header generated by `@release-it/conventional-changelog`.

**Workflow:**

1. Developer creates a file `.release-it-changeset/my-feature.md` with a user-facing description
2. On release, the plugin inserts this description into the changelog
3. The changeset file is deleted after release

## Configuration

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "./packages/release-it-changeset-plugin": {},
    "@csmith/release-it-calver-plugin": {
      "format": "yyyy.mm.minor"
    },
    "@release-it/conventional-changelog": {
      "preset": { "name": "angular" },
      "infile": "CHANGELOG.md"
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Create a changeset

```bash
echo "New user management system" > .release-it-changeset/user-management.md

Content can be as detailed as needed:

```markdown
